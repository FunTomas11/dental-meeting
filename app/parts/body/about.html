            <span class="edsa_text"><b>EDSA (European Dental Studentsâ€™ Association)</b> is an international organization representing over 70,000 students of dentistry in Europe.
                Twice a year, all EDSA delegates meet to jointly create new and improve existing projects.
                In addition, we discuss the integration of dentistry into society.
                The main goals of EDSA are to inform students about European dental organizations and policies, to support students' cooperation in their projects and to defend their interests, to develop and promote an international network of student exchanges, and to encourage national dental student associations to cooperate at an international level.</span>
