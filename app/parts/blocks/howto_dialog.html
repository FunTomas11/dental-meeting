        <h2>How to get here</h2><hr/>
        <p>We recommend you to take a plane to Warsaw - there are 2 airports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="sub">Warsaw Chopin Airport</li>
            <li class="sub">Warsaw Modlin Airport</li>
        </ul>
            <p>From the first one you can transfer to the city centre by taxi (use bolt or uber app or regular taxi services) or by bus - numbers 175, N32 (if you are travelling at night).</p>
            <p>To transfer from Warsaw Modlin Airport you can use taxi service  but we would recommend travelling via train (Masovian Railway) to the city centre.
            From Warsaw Central Railway station you can easily get to Lublin by train in just 2,5 hours. Make sure you pick your destination as “Lublin Główny”.
